More info:

I used cssgrid to create the layout for the main section of the page, and flexbox to control the flow of the elements inside my grid.

I used semantic HTML elements and went with a mobilefirst approach to achieve a responsive website that has great performance on mobile, as well as desktop.

I used javascript to create the navigation menu on mobile and I accompanied it with some light transitions.

This is my first time creating a mobile first website with a menu for mobile.
